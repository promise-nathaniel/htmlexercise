        <h1>Frontend Project: Basic HTML</h1>

        <p>This simple project focuses on HTML, Hypertext Mark-up Language, which is used to produce web pages.</p>

        <p>In the following pages, you are given an example which tells you how to build a web page. What you need to do is to write your own web page by choosing a specific topic, for example about you, your pet, someone you know, or an imaginary person.</p>

        <p id="under"><b>Note that when ever you go school, you are going to learn and not to play around. Remember School is a place where you study, learn, probably earn one or two skills and earn a degree.</b></p>

        <p>If you are not sure about the contentss of your file, open it with Notepad on a Windows machine. If it is readable and looks like what you typed in, you should be fine.</p>

        <p>Your web page must include the following elements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><i>a title</i></li>
            <li>at least two level headings</li>
            <li>at least one paragraph</li>
            <li>at least one list (ordered or unordered) with at least three list items</li>
            <li>at least one hyperlink to another web page</li>
            <li>atleast one image</li>
            <li id="red">at least one of the images has a thumbnail</li>
            <li>at least one horizontal rule, with author and modification date</li>
            <li>at least one kind of normal text formatting (bold, italic or underline)</li>
            <li><u>at least one table, with at least 3 columns and 3 rows</u></li>
